# Sieve of Eratosthenes: A subtle bug in prime number generation
This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered while implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in C++ for finding prime numbers. The bug lies in the way the algorithm handles memory allocation and access, specifically for large inputs.
The `bug.cpp` file shows an implementation with the bug.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected and more efficient version. This solution addresses memory management and optimizes the algorithm for better performance.
This example highlights the importance of careful memory handling and algorithmic optimization when dealing with larger datasets in C++.
